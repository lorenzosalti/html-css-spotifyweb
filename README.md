# Spotify Web

## Description

This is a front-end only project, created with a *mobile-first* approach, that aims to replicate the Spotify web app, with an emphasis on creating a responsive and user-friendly interface. 
The goal is to recreate key features such as music browsing, playlist creation, and media playback, ensuring compatibility across different devices and screen sizes.

## Focus

The focus of the project is to manage time in order to match deadlines and the client's requests. 
I was provided three specific deadlines, one for each day spent working on the project, with no additional informations. That is why in the repository there are three different folders: day-1, day-2 and day-3.

## Day 1

### Goals

1. Create the main structure with **HTML**.
2. Fully develop the **left column** in every part.

### Requests

- Make sure that the structure is solid and responsive for different viewport sizes: **mobile, tablet and desktop**.
- The code must be well **organized** and with all the necessary **comments** inorder to make it as easily readable as possible.
